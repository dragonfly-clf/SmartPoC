#### ELFM - Exceed Limit Fees Manipulation

**Criticality** critical

**Location** contract.sol#L1396,1401,1406

##### Description

The contract owner has the authority to increase over the allowed limit of 25%. The
owner may take advantage of it by calling the setMarketingFee function with a
high percentage value.

|Criticality|critical|

|Location|contract.sol#L1396,1401,1406|

```
function setMarketingFee(uint256 value) external onlyOwner {
  marketingFee = value;
  totalFees = tokenRewardsFee.add(liquidityFee).add(marketingFee);
}

```

##### Recommendation

The contract could embody a check for the maximum acceptable value.

The team should carefully manage the private keys of the owner’s account. We
strongly recommend a powerful security mechanism that will prevent a single user
from accessing the contract admin functions. That risk can be prevented by
temporarily locking the contract or renouncing ownership.
